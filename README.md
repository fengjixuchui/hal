# Welcome to HAL!

[HAL](http://eprint.iacr.org/2017/783) [/hel/] is a comprehensive reverse engineering and manipulation framework for gate-level netlists focusing on efficiency, extendability and portability. HAL comes with a fully-fledged plugin system, allowing to introduce arbitrary functionalities to the core.

Apart from multiple research projects, HAL is also used in our university lecture [Introduction to Hardware Reverse Engineering](https://www.ei.ruhr-uni-bochum.de/studium/lehrveranstaltungen/832/).

## Features
- Natural directed graph representation of netlist elements and their connections
- Support for custom gate libraries
- High performance thanks to optimized C++ core
- Modularity: write your own C++ Plugins for efficient netlist analysis and manipulation (e.g. via graph algorithms)
- A feature-rich GUI allowing for visual netlist inspection and interactive analysis
- An integrated Python shell to exploratively interact with netlist elements and to interface plugins from the GUI

## API Documentation

The C++ documentation is available [here](https://doc.hal.emsec.rub.de/).
The Python documentation can be found [here](https://py-doc.hal.emsec.rub.de/).

## Quick Start

Install or build HAL and start the GUI via `hal -g`. You can list all available options via `hal [--help|-h]`.
We included some example netlists in `examples` together with the implementation of the respective example gate library in `plugins/example_gate_library`.
For instructions to create your own gate library and other useful tutorials, take a look at the [wiki](https://github.com/emsec/hal/wiki).

Load a library from the `examples` directory and start exploring the graphical representation.
Use the integrated Python shell or the Python script window to interact. Both feature (limited) autocomplete functionality.

Let's list all lookup tables and print their Boolean functions:
```python
from hal_plugins import libquine_mccluskey

qm_plugin = libquine_mccluskey.quine_mccluskey()

for gate in netlist.get_gates():
    if "LUT" in gate.type:
        print(gate.name + " (id "+str(gate.id) + ", type " + gate.type + ")")
        print("  " + str(len(gate.input_pin_types)) + "-to-" + str(len(gate.output_pin_types)) + " LUT")
        boolean_functions = qm_plugin.get_boolean_function_str(gate, False)
        for pin in boolean_functions:
            print("  " + pin + ": "+boolean_functions[pin])
        print("")
```
For the example netlist `fsm.vhd` this prints:
```
FSM_sequential_STATE_REG_1_i_2_inst (id 5, type LUT6)
  6-to-1 LUT
  O: (~I0 I1 ~I2 I3 I4 ~I5) + (I0 ~I2 I3 I4 I5)

FSM_sequential_STATE_REG_0_i_2_inst (id 3, type LUT6)
  6-to-1 LUT
  O: (I2 I3 I4 ~I5) + (I1 I2) + (I0 I1) + (I1 ~I3) + (I1 ~I4) + (I1 ~I5)

FSM_sequential_STATE_REG_0_i_3_inst (id 4, type LUT6)
  6-to-1 LUT
  O: (~I1 ~I2 I3 ~I4 I5) + (I0 I5) + (I0 I4) + (I0 I3) + (I0 I1) + (I0 ~I2)

OUTPUT_BUF_0_inst_i_1_inst (id 18, type LUT1)
  1-to-1 LUT
  O: (~I0)

OUTPUT_BUF_1_inst_i_1_inst (id 20, type LUT2)
  2-to-1 LUT
  O: (~I0 I1) + (I0 ~I1)

FSM_sequential_STATE_REG_1_i_3_inst (id 6, type LUT6)
  6-to-1 LUT
  O: (I0 I2 I4) + (~I1 I2 I4) + (I0 ~I3 I4) + (~I1 ~I3 I4) + (I0 I4 ~I5) + (~I1 I4 ~I5) + (I2 I5) + (I2 I3) + (I1 I5) + (I1 I3) + (I0 I1) + (~I0 I5) + (~I0 I3) + (~I0 ~I1) + (I1 ~I2) + (~I0 ~I2) + (~I3 I5) + (~I2 ~I3) + (~I4 I5) + (I3 ~I4) + (I1 ~I4)
```

### macOS

Please make sure to use a compiler that supports OpenMP. You can install one from e.g. Homebrew via: `brew install llvm`.

To let cmake know of the custom compiler use following command.

`cmake .. -DCMAKE_C_COMPILER=/usr/local/opt/llvm/bin/clang -DCMAKE_CXX_COMPILER=/usr/local/opt/llvm/bin/clang++`

## Contributing

You are very welcome to contribute to the development of HAL. Feel free to submit a new pull request via github. Please consider running the static checks + clang format before that. You can also install these checks as git hooks before any commit.

### Run static checks and clang format locally
